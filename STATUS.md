# Status

> A working snapshot so you can pick up the repo cold months from now. Read top-to-bottom in 90 seconds.

**Last updated**: 2026-06-16
**Branch**: `main` (single branch — v1 and v2 consolidated)
**Tags**: `v0.1.0` (terminal TUI), `v0.2.0` (web tank + multi-provider, this release)

---

## What ships in v0.2.0

Run `signal serve` and you get:

- **HTTP + WebSocket daemon** on port 8787 (`signal serve` or `signal serve -p N`).
- **Web tank UI** served by the daemon — accessible from any browser on the same Wi-Fi via the LAN URL the daemon prints on boot.
- **PWA-installable** — "Add to Home Screen" on iOS Safari gives a fullscreen app icon.
- **Live data updates** within ~250ms of any new turn (via `fs.watch` on `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.codex/sessions`).
- **Multi-provider** — Claude Code and OpenAI Codex CLI sessions both detected and rendered. Floating provider-switcher pill (top-left) appears when both have data; single-provider users see the data rendered exactly like before. `signal doctor` reports both.
- **Two pages** in the pager: tank + settings.
- **Running terminals widget** — every `claude` and `codex` CLI process by working directory, pulsing live/recent/idle dot, tagged with provider.
- **Animated pixel-art clawd crab** (chill / focused / cooking / burning) with mood-driven moves + tap reactions.
- **Mini-game** — tap water to drop food; crab walks to exact spot; eats with sparkle + score.
- **Footstep audio** synthesized via Web Audio (no MP3 assets), distance-synced to crab movement.
- **Floating sound toggle** bottom-left + Settings toggle.
- **Toast notifications** on new turns + mood transitions.
- **Currency toggle** INR ↔ USD; FX rate editable in Settings.
- **Cards drag-and-drop** on desktop (persisted in localStorage).
- **Mobile widget grid** — 7 chips, some expandable (Models, Recent Turns).
- **Cache-savings call-out** inside the Token Flow chip.
- **Connection state visible** — green live / amber stale / red offline.

And the v0.1.0 terminal TUI is still here: `signal`, `signal status`, `signal json`, `signal doctor`, `signal config`.

## Resuming after a break

```bash
cd <repo>
bun install                # in case deps changed
cd web && bun install      # web deps separately
cd .. && bun run compile   # produces dist/signal with `serve` baked in
./dist/signal serve        # starts daemon + serves web/dist
# Open http://localhost:8787 or the LAN URL it prints
```

To work on the web UI with hot-reload (vs the bundled `dist`):

```bash
# Terminal A — daemon serves snapshot data
./dist/signal serve

# Terminal B — Vite dev server, proxies /ws + /api to the daemon
cd web && bun run dev
# Then open http://localhost:5173
```

## What's next

In rough priority order. Each item is roughly its own session.

### High-value, near-term

1. **Tauri menu-bar wrapper** — `signal-bar` macOS app that lives in the menu bar and shows the live cost in the strip; click opens a popover with the same web tank inside a webview. ~1–2 sessions.
2. **Tauri borderless desktop window** — `signal-tank` floats on a corner of the screen, always-on-top, transparent background. Same web bundle inside. ~1 session after the menu-bar one is done.
3. **Notarized macOS build + Homebrew tap** — proper distribution so anyone can `brew install affordance/tap/signal`. Includes Apple Developer ID signing + notarytool stapling. ~2 sessions.
4. **FX rate from a feed** — currently `usdToInr` is hardcoded with a user-editable override. Pull a daily rate (Open Exchange Rates free tier, or `~/.signal/fx.json` written by the daemon on boot via `fetch`). ~1 session.

### Multi-provider

5. ~~**Codex adapter**~~ — ✅ shipped in v0.2.0.
6. **Cursor adapter** — `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (SQLite). ~2 sessions (SQLite schema varies between Cursor versions).
7. **Gemini CLI adapter** — `~/.gemini/` log format check, then adapter. ~1 session.
8. **GitHub Copilot adapter** — no local logs; needs `gh auth token` + Copilot billing endpoints. Experimental flag. ~2 sessions.

### Polish

9. **Per-session-not-per-project rollups** — events already carry `sessionId`; switching the aggregation key would let you see multiple concurrent conversations in the same project as separate rows. ~half session.
10. **Cropped/optimized screenshots** — current `docs/screenshots/web.png` is 1.2MB; could go through pngcrush. ~10 minutes.
11. **Web frontend test coverage** — `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` setup; smoke-test the panel and widget components. ~1 session.
12. **`signal serve --tunnel` flag** — optional Cloudflare Tunnel / ngrok integration so you can show the tank to someone off your LAN. ~1 session, opt-in only.

### Architectural / longer-term

13. **ROI layer** — the `git_commits` table in EventStore is empty by design. Populate it via the GitJoiner stub, then surface "cost per merged PR" / "cost per shipped line" widgets. ~3–4 sessions.
14. **Predictive intervention** — burn-rate forecaster says "you'll hit 100% in 47 min at this pace"; suggest model-downgrade for cheap prompts. ~2 sessions.
15. **Live session attribution to terminal app** — currently shows project CWD; could correlate to the actual Terminal.app / iTerm2 window name via Accessibility APIs. macOS-only, ~2 sessions.

## Known limitations / "by design"

- Daemon detects `claude` / `codex` CLI processes via `pgrep` + `lsof`, **macOS-only currently**. Linux equivalent (`/proc/<pid>/cwd`) is straightforward to add.
- `fs.watch` recursive support varies on Linux; the per-provider safety poll covers it.
- Audio context starts suspended on mobile Safari; needs first user tap to unlock. Handled silently.
- No persistent server-side state beyond `~/.signal/events.db` — settings persist per-browser via localStorage. Switching devices means redoing your layout. Acceptable trade for "no auth."
